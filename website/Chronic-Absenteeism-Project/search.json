    "text": "Discussion\nAmong the models used in this study, neural networks produced the best results, outperforming all others in terms of accuracy and balanced classification metrics. Neural networks excelled at capturing the complex, nonlinear relationships between district characteristics and absenteeism outcomes, although at the cost of interpretability.\nRandom forests also performed well. They offered high predictive accuracy while maintaining greater interpretability than neural networks. Through random forests, the team extracted meaningful variable importance rankings, which provided insight into which district characteristics most influenced absenteeism rates. Random forests were particularly helpful in handling feature interactions and non-linearities without extensive preprocessing. Logistic regression also performed reasonably well. Despite its simplicity, it provided a solid baseline and was effective for binary classification. However, it struggled to capture the complex, nonlinear relationships in the data, which more flexible models like neural networks and random forests could better address.\nLDA and QDA underperformed significantly compared to the more flexible models. These methods, while theoretically suited for normally distributed data, performed poorly due to the violation of their distributional assumptions in our real-world dataset. This limited their ability to effectively model the complexities of chronic absenteeism in school districts. SVMs struggled to achieve high accuracy, especially when faced with the complexity of our data. Additionally, SVMs lacked the interpretability provided by models like random forests, which made understanding their predictions challenging.\nA major challenge during this process was dealing with highly correlated features. Initially, the dataset included detailed information on the demographic breakdown of chronic absenteeism by subgroups (e.g., absenteeism rates by race and disability status). However, many of these variables were perfectly correlated with the outcome, effectively leaking the answer into the predictors. Including them would have resulted in artificially inflated performance without yielding meaningful insights. As a result, the team removed these features and focused on broader district-level predictors, such as overall demographic composition and financial characteristics. This experience reinforced the importance of careful feature selection to ensure models are genuinely predictive rather than merely memorizing the outcome."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis study provided important insights into the factors that drive chronic absenteeism across U.S. school districts. Across all models, especially the variable importance outputs from random forests and feature weights of logistic regression, the team found that the student poverty ratio, the percentage of white students, and funding-related variables (such as state and local revenue per pupil) were consistently the most important predictors.\nDistricts with higher poverty rates tended to experience significantly higher chronic absenteeism, suggesting that broader socioeconomic disadvantages strongly affect school attendance. Similarly, districts with higher shares of white students typically had lower absenteeism rates, though this finding likely reflects deeper structural inequalities rather than direct causal effects. Less surprisingly, funding variables played a major role, as districts with greater financial resources are better positioned to support students and reduce absenteeism.\nUltimately, the results suggest that efforts to address chronic absenteeism should focus not just on in-school policies but also on broader socioeconomic conditions and resource allocation. By identifying poverty and underfunding as key risk factors, our models highlight areas where interventions could be most impactful."

    "text": "To predict whether a school district is prone to chronic absenteeism, we employed a variety of statistical learning techniques tailored to capture the complexity and potential non-linearity of influential factors. Selecting the appropriate predictive models is crucial in achieving accurate results because different techniques capture different aspects of the data, especially when relationships between factors are complex and potentially non-linear. Given class imbalance and the public policy implications of false negatives, AUC and recall were prioritized.\nTo address this challenge, we employed a combination of machine learning and statistical modeling techniques, each offering unique strengths in uncovering relationships among factors influencing chronic absenteeism. These modeling techniques included neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), logistic regression, and random forests. By leveraging a diverse set of models with varying strengths, we ensured that predictions about chronic absenteeism are generalizable and interpretable.\n\nNeural Networks\nNeural networks are flexible, data-driven models inspired by the structure and functioning of neurons in the human brain. These models are composed of interconnected layers of nodes that transform input data through a series of weighted connections and nonlinear activation functions. Each neuron receives input, applies a transformation via an activation function, and passes the result to the next layer. Neural networks can capture complex, non-linear relationships in data that are often missed by traditional linear models.\nNeural networks typically have an architecture consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. During training, the neural network learns by adjusting the weights of the connections using optimization algorithms, such as gradient descent. Adjustments in connection weights are dictated by a loss function that measures prediction error. The loss function used in a model depends on the task being performed. Binary classification tasks use binary cross entropy (BCE), multi-class classification tasks use categorical cross entropy (CCE), and regression tasks use mean squared error (MSE). Backpropagation is then applied to compute gradients of the loss concerning the model’s weights, allowing the network to learn from mistakes and improve its performance over several training iterations.\n\nBinary Classification\nTo classify districts as either “low absenteeism” or “high absenteeism,” we used a binary classification neural network. The output layer consisted of a single neuron with a sigmoid activation function, yielding a probability between 0 and 1. The model was trained with the binary cross-entropy loss function, and predictions were assigned based on a classification threshold of 0.5.\n\n\nMulti-Class Classification\nFor categorizing districts into “low,” “medium,” and “high” absenteeism levels, we used a neural network ending in a fully connected layer with three neurons, followed by a softmax activation function to convert the outputs into class probabilities. The model was trained with the categorical cross-entropy loss function, and predictions were made using the argmax of the output vector.\nAcross all tasks, the neural networks were trained using backpropagation and one of the following optimizers based on hyperparameter tuning: Adam, SGD, or RMSProp. Regularization techniques such as dropout and early stopping were employed to reduce overfitting. Hyperparameters including the number of hidden layers, neurons per layer, dropout rate, learning rate, and optimizer type were manually tuned.\n\n\n\nLinear Discriminant Analysis & Quadratic Discriminant Analysis\nLinear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) is a supervised classification technique that projects high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space to maximize class separability. LDA assumes that all classes are normally distributed and share the same covariance matrix.\nThe posterior probability of class \\(k\\) given observation \\(x\\) is calculated as:\n\\[\nP(y = k \\mid x) = \\frac{\\pi_k \\cdot \\mathcal{N}(x \\mid \\mu_k, \\Sigma)}{\\sum_j \\pi_j \\cdot \\mathcal{N}(x \\mid \\mu_j, \\Sigma)}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(\\pi_k\\) is the prior probability of class \\(k\\)\n\\(\\mathcal{N}(x \\mid \\mu_k, \\Sigma)\\) is the multivariate normal density\n\nQuadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) relaxes the assumption of shared covariance matrices. It allows each class to have its covariance matrix, enabling more flexible, nonlinear decision boundaries. However, QDA is more prone to overfitting when sample sizes are small or data is linearly separable.\nThe QDA posterior probability is:\n\\[\nP(y = k \\mid x) = \\frac{\\pi_k \\cdot \\mathcal{N}(x \\mid \\mu_k, \\Sigma_k)}{\\sum_j \\pi_j \\cdot \\mathcal{N}(x \\mid \\mu_j, \\Sigma_j)}\n\\]\nIn this study, six LDA models and three QDA models were fit. Four LDA and two QDA models were trained to predict a binary high absenteeism variable, while the others targeted the multi-class absenteeism levels.\n\n\nLogistic Regression\nLogistic regression is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks. It models the relationship between a dependent binary variable and one or more independent variables using the logistic function. The logistic function maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1, making it suitable for probability estimation.\nIn this study, logistic regression was applied to predict whether a school district is prone to chronic absenteeism. The binary target variable, high_absenteeism, was coded as 1 if the district’s absenteeism rate met or exceeded the average rate (23.6%) and 0 otherwise. A second binary target variable, high_absenteeism_doe, instead used an average rate of 28% - a statistic corresponding with the Department of Education’s findings.\nThe logistic regression model was trained using the following equation:\n\\[\nP(y = 1 \\mid X) = \\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\cdots + \\beta_p X_p)}}\n\\]\nWhere: - \\(P(y = 1 \\mid X)\\) is the probability of the district having an above average chronic absenteeism ratio.\n\n\\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept.\n\\(\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\ldots, \\beta_p\\) are the coefficients for the independent variables \\(X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_p\\).\n\nThe model was trained using the maximum likelihood estimation method to find the optimal coefficients. To evaluate its performance, we used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).\nTwo logistic regression models were implemented:\n\nA baseline model using all available predictors.\nA refined model using a subset of predictors selected through forward stepwise feature selection based on the Adjusted R-squared value.\n\n\n\nSupport Vector Machines\nSupport Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised learning models for classification and regression tasks. They work by finding the hyperplane that best separates the data into classes while maximizing the margin between classes. SVMs are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and are robust to overfitting, especially in cases where the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.\n\nBinary Classification\nFor the binary classification task, the SVM model was trained to predict whether a school district is prone to chronic absenteeism (high_absenteeism & high_absenteeism_doe). A linear kernel, radial kernel, sigmoid kernel, and polynomial kernel were all used to see which one captures relationships within the data best. The model was trained using the following objective:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\max M \\\\\n\\text{subject to} \\quad\ny_i \\left( \\sum_{k=1}^{p} w_k x_{ik} + b \\right) &\\geq M(1 - \\xi_i), \\quad \\forall i \\\\\n\\sum_{k=1}^{p} w_k^2 &= 1 \\\\\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\xi_i &\\leq C \\\\\n\\xi_i &\\geq 0, \\quad \\forall i\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\\(w_k\\) are the weights associated with each feature \\(k\\)\n\\(b\\) is the bias term\n\\(x_{ik}\\) is the value of feature \\(k\\) for observation \\(i\\)\n\\(y_i\\) is the class label for observation \\(i\\)\n\\(\\xi_i\\) are slack variables allowing for misclassifications\n\\(C\\) is the regularization parameter controlling the trade-off between maximizing the margin and allowing classification errors\n\\(M\\) is the margin to be maximized\n\nThe regularization parameter C was tuned using a grid search. The model’s performance was evaluated using accuracy, AUC, recall, precision, and F1-score.\n\n\nMulti-Class Classification\nFor the multi-class classification task, the SVM model was extended using the one-vs-all (OvA) approach, where one classifier is trained per class. The previously mentioned kernels were also used for this task. Predictions were made by aggregating the results of all binary classifiers and selecting the class with the highest score.\n\n\n\nRandom Forests\nRandom Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds many decision trees during training and outputs the mode of their predictions for classification tasks (known as majority voting). For binary classification, each tree votes for one of the two classes, and the class with the most votes becomes the model’s final prediction. Random Forests help reduce overfitting compared to a single decision tree by averaging across many trees, leading to improved generalization. The model also naturally provides estimates of feature importance, making it useful not only for prediction but also for understanding which variables are most influential in determining chronic absenteeism.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "The datasets used in this research were drawn from multiple sources, all specific to the 2022–2023 school year. Information on chronic absenteeism by school district was obtained from the U.S. Department of Education. Each record in this dataset represented a single school district and included the district’s name, state, Local Education Agency ID (LEAID), total student enrollment, number of chronically absent students, and the percentage of students classified as chronically absent (calculated as the ratio of the latter two values). The dataset also included demographic breakdowns of chronically absent students by race, gender, economic status, disability status, and English language proficiency, offering a more nuanced view of absenteeism patterns. Poverty statistics at the school district level were sourced from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE) dataset. This dataset included each district’s name, state postal abbreviation, state FIPS code, District ID, estimated K–12 population, and estimated number of K–12 students living in poverty. Racial demographics for each school district were retrieved from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which provided counts of American Indian, Asian, Hispanic, Black, White, Hawaiian, and other racial groups, along with the district’s Agency ID (equivalent to LEAID). Finally, financial data were also obtained from NCES and included a range of district-level financial metrics, organized by LEAID. For this study, the analysis focused on seven key variables: total federal revenue, total state revenue, total local revenue, total expenditures, total salaries, total employee benefits, and expenditure per student.\nInformation gathered from these datasets demonstrates predictive power regarding chronic absenteeism. Specifically, since demographic data (including race, sex, and economic well-being) was used to predict chronic absenteeism among individual third graders, the team hypothesized that similar information could be generalized to the school district level to help address the proposed research questions (@wu2024leveraging). Although none of the studies reviewed incorporated financial data, the team identified these features as potentially strong predictors. The reasoning is that wealthier districts have access to resources that less affluent districts may not have. Additionally, school districts that offer higher salaries and better benefits to their staff may foster more supportive environments that encourage student attendance. This study contributes to the existing literature by incorporating financial data, a factor previously unexplored in this context.\nThe various datasets were consolidated into a single comprehensive dataset by merging on the Local Education Agency ID (LEAID). Most of the datasets already included the LEAID; however, the poverty-specific dataset from SAIPE did not. Fortunately, the LEAID could be constructed by combining the state FIPS code and the district ID for each row. In every LEAID, the first one or two digits represent the state FIPS code, while the remaining digits correspond to the district ID. By inserting the appropriate number of leading zeros between these components, a standardized LEAID was generated for each district in the poverty dataset. Once a LEAID column was present in all datasets, they were merged programmatically to form one unified dataset suitable for machine learning analysis. Each row in the final dataset represented a single school district, containing all the demographic, financial, and absenteeism-related features described earlier.\nUpon further inspection of the data, the team noticed that demographic features related to the exact counts of students could not be used, as they were perfectly correlated with the target. To avoid data leakage and overfitting from features that encode the label via aggregation (e.g., chronically absent counts), we retained only proportion-based demographic variables. The final set of variables used in modeling can be found below in Table 1.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Variables used in chronic absenteeism modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Name\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nhigh_absenteeism\nBinary variable: 1 if chronic absenteeism ≥ 23.6%, 0 otherwise\n\n\nhigh_absenteeism_doe\nBinary variable: 1 if chronic absenteeism ≥ 28% (Dept. of Education threshold)\n\n\nabsenteeism_class\nMulti-class label: 1 = Low, 2 = Medium, 3 = High risk\n\n\ntotal_students\nTotal number of students in the district\n\n\namerican_indian_alaska_native_pct\n% of students identifying as American Indian or Alaska Native\n\n\nasian_pacific_islander_pct\n% of students identifying as Asian or Pacific Islander\n\n\nhispanic_pct\n% of students identifying as Hispanic\n\n\nblack_african_american_pct\n% of students identifying as Black or African American\n\n\nwhite_pct\n% of students identifying as White\n\n\nhawaiian_pacific_islander_pct\n% of students identifying as Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander\n\n\nstudent_poverty_ratio\nProportion of students from low-income backgrounds\n\n\ntotal_federal_revenue\nTotal federal revenue received by the district\n\n\ntotal_state_revenue\nTotal state revenue received by the district\n\n\ntotal_local_revenue\nTotal local revenue received by the district\n\n\ntotal_expenditures\nTotal expenditures by the district\n\n\ntotal_salaries\nTotal amount spent on salaries\n\n\ntotal_employee_benefits\nTotal amount spent on employee benefits\n\n\nexpenditures_per_student\nAverage amount spent per student in the district\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Introduction\nThere is ample evidence demonstrating a strong positive correlation between attendance and academic performance in primary education in the United States. During the school year, chronically absent students - those who miss 10% or more of school days - are significantly more likely to underperform academically and drop out of school (@used2024chronic). The COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted education nationwide through prolonged school closures and the shift to remote learning, leading to a sharp rise in chronic absenteeism. While chronic absenteeism has decreased since its high in the 2021-2022 school year (31%), it is well above the typical rates of chronic absenteeism seen before the pandemic (less than 20% from 2017-2020) (@ede2021chronic). This problem is especially acute in some of our major cities; chronic absenteeism climbed from 26.5% in 2018-2019 to 34.8% in 2023-2024 in New York City public schools (@egorov2025chronic). If this trend continues, it could have profound and lasting consequences for the future well-being of American students and society at large.\nThis study aims to address the growing challenge of chronic absenteeism by applying a range of machine-learning techniques to predict which districts are at higher risk. Leveraging student demographic and district economic data, the goal is to enable early, targeted interventions by policymakers. This research is guided by several key questions: Can districts with high rates of chronic absenteeism be accurately predicted, which modeling approach achieves the highest AUC when predicting chronic absenteeism at the district level, and which covariates exhibit the strongest marginal effects on classification probability? By answering these questions, the study seeks to provide actionable insights that can help combat the chronic absenteeism crisis.\nPrevious research primarily used machine learning techniques to predict chronic absenteeism at the student level. One study applied k-means clustering and Naive Bayes models to group students by risk level, ultimately achieving 90% accuracy by focusing on clearly defined attendance patterns and highlighting the importance of peer relationships and positive reinforcement (@bowen2022revealing). Another study used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with SMOTE to improve early warning systems, outperforming traditional logistic regression models and demonstrating the potential for more targeted, data-driven interventions (@wu2024leveraging). A third study focused on autistic students, using deep learning models such as LSTM and MLP to forecast attendance with high accuracy, identifying behavior-related factors as key predictors (@jarbou2022deep).\nWhile these studies have shown the promise of machine learning at the student level, this project shifts the focus to the district level - aiming to predict which school districts are most at risk of high chronic absenteeism and to identify the most influential factors driving these predictions."
