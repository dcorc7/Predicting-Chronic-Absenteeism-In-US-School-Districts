title: Predicting Chronic Absenteeism in US School Districts
---

## Abstract

Chronic absenteeism in school districts across the U.S. is a growing concern, as it negatively impacts student performance and long-term success. Students are classified as chronically absent if they miss at least 10% of school days. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted education nationwide and contributed to higher chronic absenteeism rates, even after schools reopened. This study aims to predict which school districts are at risk of high chronic absenteeism by leveraging demographic and financial data from the 2022–2023 school year. We developed classification models to predict whether a district exhibits high absenteeism, defined using two binary target variables: (1) the U.S. Department of Education’s benchmark of 28%, and (2) the dataset’s actual mean absenteeism rate of approximately 24%. The dataset includes student demographics (sex and race), rates of homelessness and poverty, language diversity, disability rates, and financial data such as total revenue (federal, state, and local) and total employee salaries and benefits. Using these features, several binary classification models were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and a Neural Network. The Neural Network and Random Forest models performed best, achieving accuracies of 73% (AUC = 0.815) and 74% (AUC = 0.728), respectively. Feature importance analysis revealed that the student poverty ratio, the percentage of white students in a district, total federal revenue received, and total employee benefits were the most significant predictors of chronic absenteeism. These findings suggest that chronic absenteeism can be effectively predicted using demographic and financial indicators, providing a foundation for data-driven policy interventions to support at-risk districts.

## Introduction

There is ample evidence demonstrating a strong positive correlation between attendance and academic performance in primary education in the United States. During the school year, chronically absent students - those who miss 10% or more of school days - are significantly more likely to underperform academically and drop out of school (@used2024chronic). The COVID-19 pandemic further disrupted education nationwide through prolonged school closures and the shift to remote learning, leading to a sharp rise in chronic absenteeism. While chronic absenteeism has decreased since its high in the 2021-2022 school year (31%), it is well above the typical rates of chronic absenteeism seen before the pandemic (less than 20% from 2017-2020) (@ede2021chronic). This problem is especially acute in some of our major cities; chronic absenteeism climbed from 26.5% in 2018-2019 to 34.8% in 2023-2024 in New York City public schools (@egorov2025chronic). If this trend continues, it could have profound and lasting consequences for the future well-being of American students and society at large.

This study aims to address the growing challenge of chronic absenteeism by applying a range of machine-learning techniques to predict which districts are at higher risk. Leveraging student demographic and district economic data, the goal is to enable early, targeted interventions by policymakers. This research is guided by several key questions: Can districts with high rates of chronic absenteeism be accurately predicted, which modeling approach achieves the highest AUC when predicting chronic absenteeism at the district level, and which covariates exhibit the strongest marginal effects on classification probability? By answering these questions, the study seeks to provide actionable insights that can help combat the chronic absenteeism crisis.

Previous research primarily used machine learning techniques to predict chronic absenteeism at the student level. One study applied k-means clustering and Naive Bayes models to group students by risk level, ultimately achieving 90% accuracy by focusing on clearly defined attendance patterns and highlighting the importance of peer relationships and positive reinforcement (@bowen2022revealing). Another study used Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) with SMOTE to improve early warning systems, outperforming traditional logistic regression models and demonstrating the potential for more targeted, data-driven interventions (@wu2024leveraging). A third study focused on autistic students, using deep learning models such as LSTM and MLP to forecast attendance with high accuracy, identifying behavior-related factors as key predictors (@jarbou2022deep).

While these studies have shown the promise of machine learning at the student level, this project shifts the focus to the district level - aiming to predict which school districts are most at risk of high chronic absenteeism and to identify the most influential factors driving these predictions.
